NoWork!

DHS NoWork! is a notification sharing centre where staff and students can create groups by adding in their classmates, and proceed to post notifications and/or homework reminders to the entire group through a very simple sharing system. Users who open the webapp will immediately see notifications and/or homework reminders, and can proceed to mark though a ‘noted’ or a ‘done’ field, which the group admin will be able to check and be actively informed of the progress of the class. To facilitate interaction, a comment system will also be implemented where users can post questions to the rest of the group related to the homework / notification at hand, a system where the admin of the group will be able to moderate.
